# Simulation of 4 Linear Models

Understand common assumptions behind the linear model.

Set the values of slope (a) and intercept (b) parameters. Set the sample length to 1,000.

```{r setup}
# Slope and Intercept
a <- 0.8; b <- 0.1
sample.n <- 1000
```

## Model 1.

Simulate and plot Model 1: 
Input variable $X ~ Norm(/mu = 3, /sigma = 2.5)$; model residuals $Eps ~ Norm(/mu, /sigma = 1.5)$

```{r m1}
# Simulate the model using rnorm()
set.seed(111)
model1.x <- rnorm(sample.n, mean = 3, sd = 2.5)
set.seed(1112131415)
model1.eps <- rnorm(sample.n, mean = 0, sd = 1.5)

model1.y <- (a * model1.x + b) + model1.eps
model1 <- cbind(Y=model1.y, X=model1.x, Eps=model1.eps)

# Inspect results
head(model1)
plot(model1$X, model1$Y)
```
